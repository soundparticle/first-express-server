This is an very simple database of birds I created this as an early experiment into CRUD(create ,read ,update ,delete) operations.  The app allows you to add, update, post, and delete single birds or a group lists of birds. Full CRUD! I included TDD testing of CRUD operations too!

Coded by:
Antreo Pukay

This app uses:
Mocha/Chai: for testing.
Express: for routing.
MongoDB: for database.
